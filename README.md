# C++ Server (raknet) and Unity/C# Client networking proof of concept test
An old test application to trial how it would feel to use raknet as a server with unity a unity client/front end

I developed it to the point that clients could connect to a server/lobby and chat, mostly to get a feel for how all of this might go if I tried to move to a more complex and full featured game.
